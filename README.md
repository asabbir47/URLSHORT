<h5>
This is a short project for shortening the url.
</h5>

<p>
    The Main page show a form receiving an optional folder and an url from user. After submitting the form system will generate a short url for the user. For example if the user give a url like http://example.com/folder/subfolder?q=something#hash ignoring the optional folder field the system can generate a unique url like http://hostname/4Hs8kL. If the user give an optional folder name like 'myfolder', the short url can be like this - http://hostname/myfolder/4Hs8kL. User can use multilevel folder structure like folder/subfolder to get - http://hostname/folder/subfolder/4Hs8kL
